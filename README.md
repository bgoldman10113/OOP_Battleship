This project is a spinoff of the popular board game “Battleship”. This project is to be performed using C++ and will enable players to play against another player or against the computer using artificial intelligence. In this game, users will alternate turns between another player and the computer and will have the ability to select a difficulty that changes how the game is structured. On the easiest level, the board will be 5x5 and the AI will have a lower probability to sink a ship. On the medium level of difficulty, the board will be drawn to be a 7x7 grid and the AI will use more logistical reasoning to find where the ships are located. At the expert setting, the board will be 10x10 and the AI will be programmed to sink ships in the least amount of tries. Users can also choose to have the ships randomly placed on the game board or to have them manually inputted. The targeted real world application of this project is a form of entertainment for the end user. As such, this project is important because it challenges the player’s mind by requiring strategic planning and logic.
